# CODSOFT NOV 2023 Python TASK 4 -Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Main Objective: *Rock-Paper-Scissors Game*.

The main objective of this code is to create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game involves the player selecting one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer randomly choosing one as well. The code defines functions for each possible player choice and determines the winner based on the rules of the game. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is created using Tkinter, with buttons for the player to make selections, labels to display the choices and results, and a reset button to start a new game. The game continues until the player decides to reset it.

## Libraries and Techniques Used

- **Tkinter** (`tkinter`) for data manipulation and analysis.

 **Functions** Functions are defined to handle different aspects of the game, such as resetting the game, disabling buttons, and determining the outcome based on the player's choice and the computer's random choice.

  **random** The random module is used for generating random characters in the password.

  **Labels** Labels are used to display text in the GUI, including the title of the game, the choices made by the player and computer, and the result of each match.

  **Frames** Frames are used to organize and group different elements within the GUI.

  **Buttons** Buttons are created to allow the player to make selections (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and to reset the game.
## Code Overview

This code is for a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. The game has a graphical user interface (GUI) where the user can click buttons to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes a random choice as well. The result of the match is displayed on the GUI, indicating whether the player wins, loses, or if it's a draw. The game also provides a "Reset Game" button to start a new round.
